Crow is C++ microframework for web. Support Mac, Linux, windows, three platforms, the fastest development speed, the quickest and the strongest, the next step is to support ORM. At present, the performance of the framework should be ranked in the top five in the Techempower.

### [Demo site(example_vs)](http://8.129.58.72:8080/)🚀
(inspired by Python Flask)[fork by Asciphx]

[![Travis Build](https://travis-ci.org/ipkn/crow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ipkn/crow)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/asciphx/Crow/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/asciphx/Crow?branch=master)

```c++
#include "cc.h"
int main(){
    cc::SimpleApp app;
    app["/"]([](){
        return "Hello world!";
    });
    app.port(18080).multithreaded().run();
}
```

## Features

 - Easy routing
   - Similiar to Flask
   - Type-safe Handlers (see Example)
 - Very Fast
   - ![https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KidO9XpuwCRZ2p_JRDJj2aep61H8Sh_KDOhApizv4LE/pubchart?oid=2041467789&format=image](./Benchmark.png)
   - More data on [crow-benchmark](https://github.com/ipkn/crow-benchmark)
 -  The third-party JSON parser [Nlohmann json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) is used for static reflection and outputs JSON.
 - [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/) based templating library (cc::mustache)
 - Header only
 - Provide an amalgamated header file [`crow_all.h`](https://github.com/ipkn/crow/releases/download/v0.1/crow_all.h) with every features ([Download from here](https://github.com/ipkn/crow/releases/download/v0.1/crow_all.h))
 - Middleware support
 - Websocket support
 - Support static resources and the default is in the 'static/' directory
 - Modular development, high efficiency, simple code
## Still in development
 - ~~Built-in ORM~~
   - Check [sqlpp11](https://github.com/rbock/sqlpp11) if you want one.
 - CORS is now allowed to be specially configured in 'config.h'
## Examples
#### Upload file
```c++
  app.post("/upload")([](cc::Req& req) {
	  cc::Parser<2048> msg(req);
	  json j = json::object();
	  for (auto p : msg.params) {
	    if (!p.size) j[p.key] = p.value; else j[p.key] = p.filename;
	  }
	  return j;
	});
```
#### sql query
```c++
  app["/sql"]([] {
	auto q = d.conn();
	//std::tuple<int, std::string> ds=q("select id,name from users_test where id = 1").template r__<int,std::string>();
	//std::cout<<std::get<0>(ds)<<std::get<1>(ds);
	int i = 0; q("SELECT 200+2").r__(i);
	std::string s; q("SELECT 'hello world'").r__(s);
	return Res(i,s);
  });
```
#### Static reflection
```c++
  app["/list"]([]() {
	User u; List list{ &u }; json::parse(list, R"({"user":{"is":false,"age":25,"weight":50.6,"name":"deaod"},
	  "userList":[{"is":true,"weight":52.0,"age":23,"state":true,"name":"wwzzgg"},
	  {"is":true,"weight":51.0,"name":"best","age":26}]})");
	json json_output = json(list);
	return json_output;
  });
```
#### Server rendering
```c++
  app.default_route()([] {
	char name[64];gethostname(name,64);
	json j{{"servername",name}};
	return mustache::load("404NotFound.html").render(j);
  });
```

#### JSON Response
```c++
app["/json"]([]{
    cc::json x;
	x["message"]="Hello, World!";
	x["double"]=3.1415926;
	x["int"]=2352352;
	x["true"]=true;
	x["false"]=false;
	x["null"]=nullptr;
	x["bignumber"]=2353464586543265455;
    return x;
});
```

#### Arguments
```c++
app["/hello/<int>"]([](int count){
    if (count > 100) return cc::Res(400);
    std::ostringstream os;
    os << count << " bottles of beer!";
    return cc::Res(os.str());
});
```
Handler arguments type check at compile time
```c++
// Compile error with message "Handler type is mismatched with URL paramters"
app["/another/<int>"]([](int a, int b){
    return cc::Res(500);
});
```

#### Handling JSON Requests
```c++
app.post("/add_json")
([](cc::Req& req){
    auto x = cc::json::load(req.body);
    if (!x) return cc::Res(400);
	int sum=x["a"].get<int>()+x["b"].get<int>();
    std::ostringstream os;
    os << sum;
    return cc::Res{os.str()};
});
```

## How to Build

If you just want to use crow, copy amalgamate/cc_all.h and include it.

### Requirements
 - C++ compiler with good C++17 support (tested with g++>8.0)
 - Any version of boost library
 - CMake for build examples
 - Linking with tcmalloc/jemalloc is recommended for speed.
 - Now supporting VS2019 with limited functionality (only run-time check for url is available.)

### Building (Tests, Examples)
Out-of-source build with CMake is recommended.
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
You can run tests with following commands:
```
ctest
```
### Installing missing dependencies
#### Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install build-essential libtcmalloc-minimal4 && sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libtcmalloc_minimal.so.4 /usr/lib/libtcmalloc_minimal.so
#### OSX
    brew install boost google-perftools
#### Windows
> first install boost  
> second modify CmakeLists.txt

##### CmakeLists.txt[example]
```cmake
SET(BOOST_ROOT "E:/Code/boost_1_75_0") #Installation address of decompressed version
set(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS ON) #Support anything else
```
